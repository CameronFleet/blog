# Building a Modern Blog with Next.js and MDX

When I decided to rebuild my blog, I wanted something that would be fast, developer-friendly, and easy to maintain. After exploring various options, I settled on a combination of **Next.js**, **MDX**, and **Tailwind CSS**. Here's why this stack works so well and how you can build something similar.

## Why This Stack?

### Next.js for Performance
Next.js gives us incredible performance out of the box with:
- Static Site Generation (SSG) for blazing fast load times
- Built-in image optimization
- Automatic code splitting
- SEO-friendly routing

### MDX for Content
MDX combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components:

```jsx
// You can use React components directly in your posts!
<CustomComponent data={someData} />

// Or embed interactive examples
<InteractiveDemo />
```

### Tailwind CSS for Styling
Tailwind provides:
- Consistent design system
- Responsive design utilities
- No CSS conflicts
- Excellent developer experience

## Setting Up the Project

Let's start with a fresh Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-blog --typescript --tailwind --app
cd my-blog
```

Then add the MDX dependencies:

```bash
npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react
npm install remark-gfm rehype-highlight
```

## Creating the Blog Structure

The key to a maintainable blog is good organization:

```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── page.tsx          # Homepage
│   ├── posts/
│   │   └── [slug]/
│   │       └── page.tsx  # Individual post pages
│   └── about/
│       └── page.tsx      # About page
├── components/
│   └── blog/
│       ├── Header.tsx
│       ├── Footer.tsx
│       └── PostCard.tsx
├── lib/
│   └── posts.ts          # Post utilities
└── posts/
    └── *.mdx             # Your blog posts
```

## The Power of MDX Components

One of the best features of MDX is the ability to create custom components for your posts:

```tsx
const components = {
  h1: ({ children }) => (
    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">{children}</h1>
  ),
  code: ({ children }) => (
    <code className="bg-gray-100 px-2 py-1 rounded">
      {children}
    </code>
  ),
  // Add interactive components
  Demo: ({ title }) => (
    <div className="border p-4 rounded-lg">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      <button onClick={() => alert('Hello!')}>
        Click me!
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Performance Considerations

Here are some key optimizations I implemented:

1. **Static Generation**: All posts are pre-rendered at build time
2. **Image Optimization**: Using Next.js Image component
3. **Bundle Splitting**: Components are only loaded when needed
4. **SEO Optimization**: Proper meta tags and structured data

## What's Next?

Some features I'm planning to add:

- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Comment system
- [ ] Newsletter integration
- [ ] Dark mode support
- [ ] Analytics dashboard

## Conclusion

This setup gives you a blog that's:
- **Fast**: Static generation means instant page loads
- **Flexible**: MDX components let you create rich content
- **Maintainable**: TypeScript and good structure prevent bugs
- **Scalable**: Can handle hundreds of posts without performance issues

The developer experience is fantastic, and the end result is a blog that both you and your readers will love.
